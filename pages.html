    <dt><a href="quizlet">quizlet</a> (~8.7kb gzipped)</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
        a quiz generator, using <a href="https://opentdb.com/">OpenTDB</a> to
        supply the questions.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was originally made as a challenge to see if I could make a mostly
        accessible (by my current standards, let me know if/how it can be
        improved) test / score system that used css to do all the interactivity
        of the quiz (once generated).
      </p>
      <p>
        Afterwards I focused on making the quiz's that were generated print
        friendly and styling the questions around grade school tests using more
        css.

    <dd>
      a very long (endless) horse, inspired by
      <a href="https://secure.endless.horse/">endless.horse</a> after seeing it
      and wanting to make a very small and lightweight clone without a dependency
      on jquery or anything like that.

      <a href="tower-unite-laser-expression-simulator">tower unite laser projector simulator</a>
      (~45kb gzipped)
    </dt>
    <dd>
      <p>A simulator for <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1136940994">Tower Unite's laser expressions</a>.</p>
      <p>The parser uses parser-lang, this made writing the parser pretty easy and only took an hour or so. Most of the time was spent verifying behavior between Tower Unite and my parser.</p>
      <p>I wrote a basic ast node based interpreter, but it wasn't very efficient so I wrote a bytecode compiler and interpreter and the significantly improved things. Even still, I still wanted better performance and so I wrote a bytecode interpreter in assemblyscript.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, most of the transferred size is from the wasm binary generated from assemblyscript.</p>
      <p>The actual projector output is a simple canvas 2d renderer.</p>
      <p>If I come back to this in the future, I'd like to transpile the language to a gpu shader, handwrite the parser, and improve the wasm binary size.</p>
      <p>Most of the interpreter's logic is pretty simple, it's just a bit tedious to write by hand. So making a small language similar to walt for generating a smaller wasm binary might be beneficial.</p>
